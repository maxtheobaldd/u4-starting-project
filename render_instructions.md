# How to Render the Fixed Mermaid Flowchart

## Option 1: Open the HTML File Directly (Recommended)

1. **Open the file**: Double-click on [`mermaid_flowchart.html`](mermaid_flowchart.html:1) in your file explorer
2. **Or**: Right-click the file and select "Open with" → your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
3. **Or**: In your browser, press Ctrl+O (or Cmd+O on Mac) and navigate to the file

The HTML file includes the Mermaid library and will automatically render the flowchart with all boxes having black backgrounds and white text.

## Option 2: VS Code Preview (If you have Mermaid extension)

1. Install the "Mermaid Preview" extension in VS Code
2. Open [`fixed_flowchart.md`](fixed_flowchart.md:1)
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+P (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
4. Type "Mermaid: Preview" and select it

## Option 3: Online Mermaid Editor

1. Go to https://mermaid.live/
2. Copy the Mermaid code from [`fixed_flowchart.md`](fixed_flowchart.md:9) (the part between the ```mermaid tags)
3. Paste it into the online editor
4. The diagram will render automatically

## Option 4: GitHub/GitLab (if using version control)

If you push the [`fixed_flowchart.md`](fixed_flowchart.md:1) file to GitHub or GitLab, they will automatically render Mermaid diagrams in markdown files.
