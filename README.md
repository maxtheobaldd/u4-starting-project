# Starting Project

## Project Brief
You are asked to use your software design, development, testing and evaluation skills to produce a program that meets the client’s requirements.  

A computer games club has commissioned you as a **Junior Software Developer** to write a program that will help the club keep a record of players’ scores and provide statistics.  

The program should allow the user to:
- Record a player’s scores  
- Display statistics  

### Required Input
The program should allow the user to enter:
- Player ID  
- Number of games played  
- Score achieved in each game  
- Length of time taken (in minutes) for each game  

### Required Output
The program should then:
- Display the player ID  
- Display the player’s highest score  
- Display the average length of time spent playing  
- Write all data to a text file  

### Development Requirements
When designing and developing the solution, make sure that:
- Standard programming conventions are followed  
- The program is efficient and robust  
- A suitable data structure is used  
- Outputs are meaningful  
- The program is easy to use  
- The solution is tested with normal, abnormal, and extreme data  

The output must show:
- The player ID  
- The player’s highest score  
- The average length of time spent playing

## Activities

### Activity One: Flowchart
Produce a flow chart, using British Computing Society symbols, to plan the logic and processes for the program.  

### Activity Two: Pseudocode
Produce pseudocode that a software developer could use to create the program.  

### Activity Three: Test Plan
Create a test table to plan the testing of your program. Include columns for:  
- Test number  
- Purpose of test  
- Test data  
- Expected result  

Save this file so it can be updated during Activity Four.  

### Activity Four: Program Development & Testing
Use your flow chart, pseudocode, and test plan to help write and test your program.  
You should:  
- Write a program that meets the scenario requirements  
- Use a C family language or Python 3.4+  
- Test throughout the development process to ensure expected functionality  
- Record the outcomes of your testing and any actions taken in the test plan document  

Evidence must include:  
- A copy of your code containing annotations/comments  
- A copy of your fully completed test plan document  

### Activity Five: Evaluation
Evaluate your program solution, covering:  
- How well your solution meets the requirements of the scenario  
- The quality and performance of your program  
- The choices you made about coding conventions  
- The changes made during the development process
